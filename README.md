# T4M<sub>enhanced</sub>-MAM

T4M-MAM loads into World at War through DirectX `d3d9.dll` and performs enhancements to the game. This fork (T4Me-MAM) provides additional features compared to T4Me needed for proper functioning of the in-development mod MAM (https://www.moddb.com/mods/material-authenticity-modification-mam) 
The mod works for valid versions of World at War on Steam or CD.
